1)	Programmer rant: on all forums you see two things:
	1. "Don't use App.config, use the new and improved appsettings.json with .NET Core!!"
	2. "Don't litter your code with hard-coded dependencies to the configuration class, use Dependency Injection!"
	While I totally agree with the second point, the first point cannot be achieved, simply because some fucktards at Microbrain decided that using IConfiguration with binders 
	and appsettings.json doesn't require persistance. In other words, yes, you can read your settings json file, yes, you can change the options in memory, but you have no
	integrated way of storing them back in the json file. Because who the fuck, pardon my French, would ever want to also save modified configurations??...
	Should I also mention the ton of dependencies that the configuration nuget packages require?.......
	So, end of rant, after 2 wasted days of googling and reading github issues: FUCK YOU, Microsoft, I'll just fucking serialize/deserialize a json file with newtonsoft.json and be done with it.
	For those interested, take a look here: https://github.com/aspnet/Configuration/issues/386#issuecomment-445504262

2) for the VLC remote controlling using C#, https://gist.github.com/SamSaffron/101357

3) for replacing Interactions and Interactivity with NET Core versions:

	Remove reference to “Microsoft.Expression.Interactions” and “System.Windows.Interactivity”
	Install the Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.Wpf NuGet package.
	XAML files – replace the xmlns namespaces http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/2010/interactivity and http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/2010/interactions with http://schemas.microsoft.com/xaml/behaviors
	C# files – replace the usings in c# files “Microsoft.Xaml.Interactivity” and “Microsoft.Xaml.Interactions” with “Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors”

make file navigation treeview asynchronous

Avalonia:
- remove textbox scrollview repeat button
- add tooltips styling
- asynchronous file listing in file system dialogs (currently blocking UI on large folders)
- navigation treeview: when an extensions filter is passed to dialog services (filesave, filebrowse, etc), the filter is not applied to the navigation treeview too (still shows all files)
					   when clicking a folder, if an extension is seleted in the extensions filter, it ignores it (shows all file types in the filter, not just the selected one)
- solve problem of dialogs not blocking any other application window (they block only their parent)
